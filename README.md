üìù Overview
This project focuses on classifying movies into multiple genres using text-based features such as plot descriptions. The key steps include:

1.Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and tokenizing text, removing stopwords, and vectorizing using TF-IDF.
2.Feature Engineering: Extracting useful information for classification.
3.Model Training: Implementing classification algorithms including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM.
4.Evaluation: Analyzing accuracy, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to determine the best model.

üìàResults
High Accuracy: The Logistic Regression model achieves approximately 93.51% test set accuracy.
Genre-Specific Performance:
Strong performance for genres with ample data (e.g., Documentary and Drama).
Lower recall for genres like Comedy and Short, indicating the need for more data or feature refinement.
